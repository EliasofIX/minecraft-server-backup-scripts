## My Minecraft server backup scripts!

I run a Minecraft server with my friends and I got annoyed that I have to manually backup the world every few hours, very impractical, so I create these scripts to automate that process.

### How does it work?

mc-backup-hourly.sh automates hourly backups that get deleted after 24h.
mac-backup-weekly.sh automates weekly backups that get kept indefinitely.

Idk if anybody finds use of this outside of me but if you do I'm glad that you do!
